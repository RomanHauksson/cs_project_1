- I can't believe I put off this project until now. I spent all day today debugging the resizing of a fallback font for a side project instead of starting this. I'll just accept the 15% penalty and turn it in by EOD tomorrow.
- For this session, I just want to get a handle on what exactly it is I'm supposed to accomplish, and set up the environment. Not sure whether I should use Python, Java, or C++. I'll try just using Python, but I'll want to set up types. I've heard good things about Mypy.
- Just looked online. Interesting to see Astral is making their own type checker now, but it's not ready for production yet. I'll just use Pyright.
- Now I'm going to read to figure out what the project should look like.
